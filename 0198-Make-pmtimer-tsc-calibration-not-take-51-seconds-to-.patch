Subject: [PATCH 198/198] Make pmtimer tsc calibration not take 51 seconds to
 fail.

On my laptop running at 2.4GHz, if I run a VM where tsc calibration
using pmtimer will fail presuming a broken pmtimer, it takes ~51 seconds
to do so (as measured with the stopwatch on my phone), with a tsc delta
of 0x1cd1c85300, or around 125 billion cycles.

If instead of trying to wait for 5-200ms to show up on the pmtimer, we try
to wait for 5-200us, it decides it's broken in ~0x7998f9e TSCs, aka ~2
million cycles, or more or less instantly.

Additionally, this reading the pmtimer was returning 0xffffffff anyway,
and that's obviously an invalid return.  I've added a check for that and
0 so we don't bother waiting for the test if what we're seeing is dead
pins with no response at all.
