Subject: [PATCH 86/97] ppc64le has no separate /boot mount (#1261926)

The patch for rhbz#1212114 ensures that ppc64le systems sync grub config
changes to disk prior to grub-mkconfig completion and a reboot.

This patch required checking for /boot as its own mount point because
issuing fsfreeze to a root partition is unwise. For administrators who
configured a ppc64le system with no separate /boot partition, the failed
check results in an error message. The file is written and would work
most of the time, however, it also introduces a corner case where the
behavior manifested in rhbz#1212114 could re-appear on these systems.

The system call issued by fsfreeeze is being issued by methods within
the anaconda installer and can be removed from GRUB proper.
